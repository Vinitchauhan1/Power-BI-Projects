# Power-BI-Projects

### Project Overview

In this project, we aim to assemble a dream team of the top 11 cricket players from various international teams, utilizing data from the 2022 T20 World Cup. This involves gathering data, cleaning and preparing it, conducting analysis, and visualizing insights to form the ultimate cricket squad.

### Project Execution

Here's a breakdown of how I tackled this project:

1. **Data Acquisition:** I employed Python-based Web Scraping techniques to extract relevant data from ESPNcricinfo.com.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Using Python along with Pandas, I cleaned and prepared the acquired data to ensure its accuracy and consistency.

3. **Data Transformation and Visualization:** Leveraging PowerBI and DAX queries, I transformed the data into meaningful insights and created visually appealing dashboards for analysis.

4. **Deployment:** The finalized dashboards were deployed on the PowerBI server, enabling seamless sharing and access for stakeholders.

### Interactive Reporting

The analysis results are presented in an interactive Power BI report, showcasing the top 11 players based on selected performance metrics. Users can explore the data, uncover underlying trends, and make informed decisions.

### Learning Experience

Embarking on this project from scratch has significantly enhanced my confidence in data analytics and visualization skills. The process has been both challenging and rewarding, providing invaluable hands-on experience.
